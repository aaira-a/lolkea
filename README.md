# lolkea

A web app based to keep track of item stock at a certain Swedish furniture company, specifically at their Malaysian outlet.

## Background

They have their own item stock checker on their website, however there are occurrences where the items itself were out of stock IRL even though the website states differently. This usually happens when the stock count is low (<50). 

This web app aims to provide more accurate guesstimates of certain item stock based on the information gathered from multiple readings in a few consecutive days.
